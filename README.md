# YOLO Parking Slot Counter 🚗📸

This project uses a modified YOLOv5 model to estimate the number of available parking slots from a parking lot image.

This project was done as part of the mid-term assignment for the class named "디자인적사고 (Design Thinking)" from Khyung Hee University. It was based on the topic of "Maker Movement - Utilizing Open-Source" by using YOLOv5 object detection tool.
